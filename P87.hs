-- Problem 87:: Depth-first order graph traversal (alternative solution) 

import Data.List 

data Graph a = Graph [a] [(a, a)]   deriving (Show, Eq)
data Adjacency a = Adj [(a, [a])]   deriving (Show, Eq)
data Friendly a = Edge [(a, a)]     deriving (Show, Eq)

{-
A graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges, where each edge is a pair of nodes.

Example in Haskell: 

depthfirst ([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [(1,2),(2,3),(1,4),(3,4),(5,2),(5,4),(6,7)]) 1
[1,2,3,4,5]
